`fast-mda-traceroute` is an experimental multipath traceroute tool based on [caracal][caracal]
and [diamond-miner][diamond-miner]. It aims to provide a faster alternative to [paris-traceroute][paris-traceroute]
and [scamper][scamper] for running one-off measurements. It runs on Linux and macOS, on x86-64 and ARM64 systems.

ðŸš§ This tool is highly experimental, may not always work, and its interface is subject to change from one commit to
another.

## Quickstart

### Docker

```bash
docker run ghcr.io/dioptra-io/fast-mda-traceroute --help
```

The `latest` tag maps to the latest tagged commit and the `main` tag maps to the latest commit on the `main` branch.

### Python

You can use pip, or [pipx][pipx] to install `fast-mda-traceroute` in a dedicated virtual environment:

```bash
pipx install fast-mda-traceroute
fast-mda-traceroute --help
```

## Usage

```bash
# Show help
fast-mda-traceroute --help
# Multipath traceroute towards example.org with default options
fast-mda-traceroute example.org
# Print paris-traceroute equivalent command
fast-mda-traceroute --print-command=paris-traceroute example.org
# Print scamper equivalent command
fast-mda-traceroute --print-command=scamper example.org
```

`fast-mda-traceroute` outputs log messages to `stderr` and measurement results to `stdout`.

## Development

```bash
poetry install
poetry run fast-mda-traceroute --help
```

```bash
docker build -t fast-mda-traceroute .
docker run fast-mda-traceroute --help
```
