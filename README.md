`fast-mda-traceroute` is an experimental multipath traceroute tool based on [caracal][caracal]
and [diamond-miner][diamond-miner]. It aims to provide a faster alternative to [paris-traceroute][paris-traceroute]
and [scamper][scamper] for one-off measurements. It runs on Linux and macOS, on x86-64 and ARM64 systems.

ðŸš§ This tool is highly experimental, may not always work, and its interface is subject to change from one commit to
another.

## Quickstart

### Docker

```bash
docker run ghcr.io/dioptra-io/fast-mda-traceroute --help
```

### Python

You can use pip, or [pipx][pipx] to install `fast-mda-traceroute` in a dedicated virtual environment:

```bash
pipx install fast-mda-traceroute
fast-mda-traceroute --help
```

Note that we do not yet provide ARM64 binary wheels for Caracal and Diamond-Miner. If you use such as a system (e.g. a
Raspberry Pi or an Apple M1-based machine) you must have a C++ compiler installed and the installation time might be a
little longer (~5 minutes on a M1 MacBook Air).

## Usage

```bash
fast-mda-traceroute --help
fast-mda-traceroute example.org
```

`fast-mda-traceroute` outputs log messages to `stderr` and its results to `stdout`.

## Development

```bash
poetry install
poetry run fast-mda-traceroute --help
```

```bash
docker build -t fast-mda-traceroute .
docker run fast-mda-traceroute --help
```
